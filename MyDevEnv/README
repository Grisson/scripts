What is in my Linux dev workstation.
 

Thanks to my new job, I finally get a chance to use Linux as my main develop environment. I want to document what I put into my machine to make me look like a pro. :)
I. Shell
I use bash because it works almost everywhere. I used fish shell for a while. But I gave it up because of its impactiable wit Bash.

II. Bash-It
I use bash-it because it doesn't raly on Powerline. My experience with Powerline is awful.

III. Tmux
I need to ssh to multiple servers and work on them simultaneously. So, I use tmux for its multi-window capability.

IV. vim-plug
I use vim-plug for it simplicity.

V. Azure Cli
It is super handy if you use Azure


That is it.
